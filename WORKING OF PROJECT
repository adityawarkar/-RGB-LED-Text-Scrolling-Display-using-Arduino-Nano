Arduino working logic:   
Arduino can work with WS2812B LEDs using the ADAFRUIT library, which provides a 
convenient way to control these addressable RGB LEDs. Here's a general overview of how 
Arduino can interact with WS2812B LEDs 
 
• Hardware Connections: Connect the data pin of the WS2812B LED strip to one of the 
digital pins of the Arduino. Also, connect the ground (GND) and power (VCC) pins of the LED 
strip to the corresponding pins on the Arduino or a separate power source  
 
• Define LED Parameters: Declare the number of LEDs in your strip and the Arduino pin 
connected to the data line of the WS2812B LEDs.  
 
• Create LED Array: Create an array of CRGB objects, representing the RGB colour values 
for each LED in the strip  
 
• Control LED Colours: In the loop () function, you can manipulate the LED colours using 
various Fast LED functions.  
 
• Power Considerations: Ensure that you provide an adequate power supply to the WS2812B 
LED strip, especially if you have a large number of LEDs or if they are set to display bright 
and saturated colours. The power supply should be able to provide sufficient current to all the 
LEDs in the strip.
