a. Connect the 5V pin of the LED strip to the 5V pin on the Arduino Nano Board.  
b. Connect the GND (ground) pin of the LED strip to the GND pin on the Arduino Nano. 
c. Connect the DIN (data input) pin of the LED strip to digital pin on the Arduino pin no 6. 
d. Open Arduino IDE Sketch a program as required then do compile and upload to board. 
e. After done uploading check the program output which will get on RGB LED strip. 
f. The Output can be varied by changes in program like delay, matrix colour code, texting,                  
Looping Functon.
